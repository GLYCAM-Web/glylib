**This version of the library is intended for use with newer code and
to compile using modern compilers.**

Certain code written before 2024 might not work with this version.
If you want to use a legacy version that will work with older code or 
compilers, see the old-compilers branch or the legacy branch.  

This is a library designed to facilitate programming relevant to 
molecular data.

Please see http://glycam.org/glylib for detailed documentation.

Briefly:

Requires:  

    C compiler and/or C++ compiler
    make utilities
    GNU-compatible compilers are preferred

To build:

    cd lib
    make  # to make for C and C++

    - If you only want C:

        make justC

    - For only C++:

        make justCpp

To use:

    You need to make your compile aware of the inc and lib directories 
    and -lglylib or -lglylib++, depending on the compiler.  In most cases, 
    you will also need -lm.

For example:

    gcc mycode.c -L/path/to/glylib/lib -I/path/to/glylib/inc -lglylib -Wall -lm
      -or- 
    g++ mycode.c -L/path/to/glylib/lib -I/path/to/glylib/inc -lglylib++ -Wall -lm
